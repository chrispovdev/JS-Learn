# JavaScript Learning Compilation

This repository is a compilation of resources and knowledge I've accumulated from various courses during my self-taught journey in learning JavaScript. It serves as a personal knowledge base and reference for best practices, concepts, and projects Iâ€™ve worked on along the way.

## Resources

Here are some of the key resources that have been invaluable to my learning:

- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)
- [Udemy JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course)
- [Midudev JavaScript Course](https://www.aprendejavascript.dev/)

> **Note:** This project is a work in progress (WIP) and will be continuously updated.
